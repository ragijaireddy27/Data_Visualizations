# Data Visualizations Portfolio Project

Welcome to my **Data Visualizations Portfolio Project**! This repository showcases various visualizations that I've created using different tools such as **Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Python**. The project includes charts, graphs, and pivot tables to represent key insights from the dataset, making data easier to understand and interpret.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Charts with Pivot Tables in Excel**
- In this section, I demonstrate the use of Excel to create pivot tables and various charts to analyze and visualize sales data.
- **File**: `charts_with_pivot_tables.xlsx`

### 2. **Visualizations with Power BI**
- This Power BI file showcases different types of visualizations created using Power BI to explore sales data and trends. It includes bar charts, line graphs, and other visual representations of the dataset.
- **File**: `visualizations(different_types)_on_sales_data.pbix`

### 3. **Visualizations in Python (Jupyter Notebooks)**
- This section contains Jupyter Notebooks that use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create various visualizations.
  - **File**: `visualizations_on_online_retailer.ipynb` - Visualizations created for the Online Retailer dataset.
  - **File**: `matplotlib1.ipynb`, `matplotlib2.ipynb` - Basic to advanced visualizations using **Matplotlib**.
  - **File**: `seaborn.ipynb` - Visualizations created using the **Seaborn** library.

### 4. **Matplotlib Basics**
- This notebook covers basic **Matplotlib** functionalities to create various types of plots like line, bar, and scatter plots.
- **File**: `matplotlibbasics.ipynb`

### 5. **Advanced Matplotlib Visualizations**
- This notebook showcases more advanced **Matplotlib** visualizations, including customization of plots and working with multiple subplots.
- **File**: `matplotlib1.ipynb`, `matplotlib2.ipynb`

### 6. **Seaborn Visualizations**
- This notebook demonstrates the use of the **Seaborn** library for creating statistical plots like box plots, violin plots, and pair plots.
- **File**: `seaborn.ipynb`

## Dataset

The datasets used for visualizations come from various sales data sources. Each file demonstrates how to visualize different aspects of the dataset, such as sales trends, product performance, and customer demographics.

## Technologies Used

- **Excel**: Used to create pivot tables and basic charts for data analysis.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python**:
  - **Matplotlib**: Used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  - **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for more advanced statistical visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used to run Python code for creating visualizations.

## Workflow

1. **Charts and Pivot Tables in Excel**: Basic visualizations using pivot tables and charts to summarize the sales data.
2. **Power BI Visualizations**: Interactive and dynamic visualizations created in Power BI for exploring sales trends and product performance.
3. **Matplotlib & Seaborn Visualizations**: Advanced visualizations created in Python to showcase key data insights.
